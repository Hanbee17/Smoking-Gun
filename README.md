**Project Overviews**

This project is based on my ongoing interest in various crime scenes and the profiling process of detectives. The goal of this game is to create a mystery crime scene based on a true story. In the game, players will firstly see the home screen with mysterious mood background with a start button and the sound button. Clicking the “CASE” button will let the player see the trigger warning sign and the short story about the case will be given before entering the home screen. The main screen will be a one-square-room illustration with hidden clues that can be found by clicking the suspicious parts. Suspects will be added on the sides by the player clicking the right clues. Founding all pieces of clues and all suspects will let the player to move to the guessing the murderer page. The end screen will let the player pick the murderer and the correct sign will pop up with a brief story about the crime, a “Go back” button. If the player got the wrong answer, they will be given an unlimited chance to guess after seeing the wrong sign and clicking the “Go back” button to remove the pop-up screen.
